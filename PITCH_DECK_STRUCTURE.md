# CarbonScore: Winning Pitch Deck Structure (10-12 Slides)

**Goal:** Convince judges that CarbonScore is the *only* scalable, trusted solution for the SME carbon accounting market.

---

## Slide 1: The Hook (Title Slide)
*   **Title:** CarbonScore
*   **Tagline:** The AI Sustainability Analyst for the 99%.
*   **Visual:** A sleek, glowing dashboard showing a "Carbon Score" increasing.
*   **Presenter Script:** "Carbon accounting is currently broken for 99% of companies. It's too expensive, too complex, or too inaccurate. We fixed it."

## Slide 2: The Problem (The "Black Box" & The "Excel Hell")
*   **Key Point:** Current solutions are polarized.
    *   **Option A (Consultants):** High accuracy, but slow (3 months) and expensive (€10k+).
    *   **Option B (Existing SaaS like Greenly):** Fast, but "Black Box" estimates, generic advice, and low auditability.
*   **The Pain:** SMEs need *audit-ready* numbers for regulations (CSRD) and clients, but they can't afford consultants.
*   **Statistic:** "90% of SMEs have no carbon reporting today, yet they represent 50% of global emissions."

## Slide 3: The Solution (CarbonScore)
*   **Concept:** The first **AI-Native, Open-Source Standard** for carbon accounting.
*   **Three Pillars:**
    1.  **Precision:** Deterministic ADEME v17 engine (not estimates).
    2.  **Speed:** "15-Minute Audit" onboarding.
    3.  **Intelligence:** AI Action Engine that tells you *how* to reduce, not just *what* you emit.
*   **Visual:** Split screen: "Old Way" (Messy Excel/Generic Dashboard) vs "CarbonScore Way" (Clean, Action-Oriented AI Interface).

## Slide 4: The "Unfair Advantage" (Why We Win)
*   **Differentiation Matrix:**
    *   **Auditability:** We use transparent, versioned ADEME factors. Competitors use black-box estimates.
    *   **AI Depth:** We use LLMs for *reasoning* and *scenario planning*, not just text generation.
    *   **Deployment:** We offer On-Premise/Docker for sensitive data. Competitors are SaaS-only.
*   **Key Phrase:** "We are the 'Grammarly' for Carbon Reduction."

## Slide 5: Demo / Product Magic (The "Wow" Moment)
*   **Showcase:**
    1.  **The 15-Minute Onboarding:** Select sector -> AI infers profile.
    2.  **The AI Analyst:** Ask "How can I reduce my logistics footprint?" -> Get a calculated, costed plan.
    3.  **The Scenario Engine:** Toggle a switch -> See ROI and CO2 savings in real-time.
*   **Visual:** GIF or Screenshots of the "Action Engine" and "Scenario Modal".

## Slide 6: Market Opportunity (Why Now?)
*   **The Wave:** CSRD (Europe) is forcing 50,000+ companies to report. Their suppliers (SMEs) are next.
*   **TAM/SAM/SOM:**
    *   **TAM:** Global Carbon Management Market ($15B by 2028).
    *   **SAM:** European SMEs affected by supply chain pressure.
    *   **SOM:** 500k French/European SMEs needing "Audit-Lite" solutions.

## Slide 7: Business Model (Freemium to Enterprise)
*   **Core (Free/Viral):** Get the data. Standardize the market. (Scope 1 & 2).
*   **Growth (€199/mo):** Monetize the supply chain. (Scope 3, AI Invoice Parsing).
*   **Impact (Enterprise):** Monetize automation & compliance. (API, White-label).
*   **Strategy:** "Land and Expand" through supply chains.

## Slide 8: Go-To-Market (The Plan)
*   **Phase 1 (Trust):** Open ADEME Explorer (SEO magnet).
*   **Phase 2 (Scale):** "15-Minute Audit" campaigns for specific verticals (Logistics, SaaS).
*   **Phase 3 (Ecosystem):** API integrations with accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero).

## Slide 9: Technology & Trust (Under the Hood)
*   **Stack:** Microservices (FastAPI), Next.js, pgvector (AI Memory).
*   **Security:** Self-hostable, GDPR compliant by design.
*   **Audit:** PDF Reports with cryptographic QR verification.

## Slide 10: The Ask & Vision
*   **The Ask:** [Insert Funding Amount or Partnership Request] to scale the AI engine and sales team.

*   **Closing:** "Join us in building the operating system for the net-zero economy."

**Tips for Delivery:**
*   **Be Passionate:** Show you care about the *impact*, not just the tech.
*   **Keep it Simple:** Judges aren't carbon experts. Use analogies (e.g., "Grammarly for Carbon").
*   **Focus on the AI:** Highlight that your AI is *specialized* and *grounded* in data, not a generic chatbot.
