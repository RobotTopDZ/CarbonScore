Use these scripts depending on how much time you have with a judge or investor.

## ⚡ The "Handshake" Pitch (15 Seconds)
"We're building the 'Grammarly for Carbon Accounting.' While competitors give you a black-box estimate and generic advice, CarbonScore uses AI to give SMEs a precise, audit-ready footprint and a personalized roadmap to reduce it—in just 15 minutes."

## ⏱️ The "Judge's Intro" Pitch (30 Seconds)
"Hi, I'm [Name]. 90% of SMEs today don't measure their carbon footprint because consultants are too expensive and existing software is too complex.

CarbonScore solves this with the world's first **AI-Native Sustainability Analyst**. We combine a rigorous, audit-ready ADEME engine with an AI that automatically builds reduction scenarios tailored to your specific business data. We turn a 3-month consulting mission into a 15-minute automated process."

## 🚀 The "Standard" Pitch (1 Minute)
"The problem with carbon accounting today is polarization. You either pay €10k for a consultant, or you use a cheap SaaS tool that gives you 'black box' estimates you can't explain to an auditor.

CarbonScore is the bridge. We've built a platform that is **technically rigorous**—using the official ADEME standard deterministically—but **user-friendly** enough for any SME to onboard in 15 minutes.

Our secret sauce is our **AI Action Engine**. Instead of just telling a company 'You emitted 100 tons,' our AI analyzes their specific suppliers and operations to say: 'If you switch these 3 vendors and electrify 20% of your fleet, you'll save €50k and 15 tons of CO2.'

We're not just reporting the past; we're engineering the future. We're making high-precision sustainability accessible to the 99% of companies that the big players ignore."

## 🎤 The "Storytelling" Pitch (2 Minutes)
"Let me tell you about 'Logistics Co.', a typical SME. They want to work with big clients like L'Oréal, but L'Oréal demands a detailed carbon report.

Logistics Co. is stuck. Consultants want €15,000. Existing software gives them a vague estimate based on their spend, which isn't accurate enough for L'Oréal.

Enter **CarbonScore**.

The CEO logs in. Instead of a blank spreadsheet, they see a simple wizard: 'How many trucks? What fuel?'
In **15 minutes**, they have a compliant Scope 1 & 2 report.

But here's the magic. They upload their supplier invoices. Our AI reads them, maps them to precise ADEME emission factors, and identifies that 40% of their emissions come from one specific fuel supplier.

The **Action Engine** then kicks in. It simulates a scenario: 'Switching to Biofuel for 6 months.' It calculates the cost, the ROI, and the CO2 savings instantly.

The CEO downloads a PDF report with a QR code that proves the math is valid. They send it to L'Oréal and win the contract.

That is CarbonScore. We turn a regulatory burden into a competitive advantage. We are building the operating system for the net-zero economy, starting with the millions of SMEs who need this today."
