# CarbonScore: Live Demo Script

**Objective:** Show, don't just tell. Prove that the platform is fast, smart, and actionable.
**Time:** ~3-5 Minutes

---

## Part 1: The "15-Minute Audit" (Speed & UX)
*(Start on the Landing Page or Login Screen)*

**Action:** Click "Start Calculation" / "New Assessment".
**Script:** "Let's start with the onboarding. Most tools ask for 500 data points upfront. We start with the essentials."

**Action:** Fill in the Company Profile (Sector: Logistics, Employees: 50).
**Script:** "Notice I select 'Logistics'. The system immediately adapts. It won't ask me about office paper consumption first; it asks about my fleet. This is our **Adaptive Questionnaire Engine**."

**Action:** Quickly click through the form (Vehicles, Energy, etc.).
**Script:** "I'm inputting raw data—liters of fuel, kWh of electricity. Under the hood, our engine is mapping this deterministically to **ADEME Base Carbone v17** factors. No guesswork."

**Action:** Submit and land on the Dashboard.
**Script:** "And... done. In under 2 minutes, we have a compliant Scope 1 & 2 footprint. But data is just the beginning."

## Part 2: The "AI Sustainability Analyst" (Intelligence)
*(Navigate to the Dashboard / Insights section)*

**Action:** Point to the "AI Insights" or "Recommendations" section.
**Script:** "Here is where we beat the competition. A standard tool would just say 'Your emissions are high.' Look at what CarbonScore does."

**Action:** Open a specific recommendation (e.g., "Electrify Fleet").
**Script:** "Our AI Analyst has analyzed my specific data. It sees I have a high diesel usage but short average routes. It's not giving me a generic tip; it's giving me a **calculated strategy**."

**Action:** Show the "Reasoning" or "Why this?" tooltip (if available) or explain the logic.
**Script:** "It explains *why* this is the priority, citing the specific emission factors involved. It's like having a consultant on your shoulder."

---

## Part 3: The "Scenario Engine" (Actionability)
*(Navigate to the Actions / Scenarios Page)*

**Action:** Click on the "Run Scenario Analysis" button for a top recommendation.
**Script:** "Now, the CEO asks: 'What happens if I actually do this?' Let's find out."

**Action:** (Wait for the Modal to load with the detailed LLM analysis).
**Script:** "Boom. In real-time, the AI has generated a complete implementation plan."

**Action:** Scroll through the modal features.
*   **Implementation Steps:** "It gives me a step-by-step project plan."
*   **Timeline:** "A realistic 6-month timeline."
*   **Costs & ROI:** "It estimates the €50k investment and the 3-year ROI."
*   **Risks:** "It even warns me about the risks, like charging infrastructure delays."

**Script:** "This isn't a static report. It's a business case I can take to my CFO immediately."

## Part 4: The "Audit Trail" (Trust)
*(Navigate to Reports / Export)*

**Action:** Click "Generate PDF Report".
**Script:** "Finally, I need to prove this to my clients. I generate the PDF."

**Action:** Open the PDF (if possible) or point to the "Download" button.
**Script:** "This report is compliant with GHG Protocol. It includes a cryptographic QR code (future feature mention) that links back to the raw calculation lineage. It's fully audit-ready."

## Closing
**Script:** "From zero to a strategic, costed, audit-ready decarbonization plan in minutes. That is the power of CarbonScore."
